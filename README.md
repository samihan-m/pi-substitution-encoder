# pi-substitution-encoder
 Encoding/decoding data based on pi.
 Check out GUIRunner.exe (which I made using pyinstaller) in /dist/GUIRunner.exe to use it.
I used tkinter for the GUI and an algorithm made by Craig Wood (at https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/pub/pymath/pi_chudnovsky_bs_gmpy.py) to generate long lengths of pi very quickly.
